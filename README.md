#### Note: This is the Vendetta version of this theme. For Aliucord, check this one instead.

## Requirements
- Change Discord theme to Dark mode (Legacy) (if not set already)
  - If the app crashes when you enter Appearance, you'll have to enable tabV2 first. Refers to (?) for full guide on how to enable this experimental feature.

## What's new?

### Norde for Vendetta now available!
- This is the first release of Norde for this Discord client, so if you have any issue, feel free to ask me (discord info here)
##### You can check the full changelog [here](h)

## Plugin Configuration
These below are the recommended plugins & settings for the best Norde experience. You can skip this part if you want, but I recommend giving it a try.

### Bonus: tabV2
This is an experimental redesign Discord has been working on recently and can only be enabled temporarily with an easter egg. However, there is a workaround for this using a module that let you access some exclusive Staff only features, including enabling tabV2 permanently.
- First, you'll need Experiments module by Beef installed (remember to disable update of this one or it won't work properly)
- Now, go to Settings, scroll down until you see Tabs UI Experiment and just enable it.

Discord should restart afterward and you will be greeted by the brand new, redesigned UI!
